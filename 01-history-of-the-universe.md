Cultures in all regions of the world for all of known history have had [stories of the origins of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth). Since these stories contradict each other on so many points, most of them are false.

By "the world," I shall mean "what exists." In this nomenclature, the known universe is part of the world. We assume there are unknown things that exist, which are also part of the world. God is part of the world, if God exists; angels are part of the world if they exist; and so forth.

The question of the origins of the world is really a conflation of two potentially related questions. First, why does anything exist? This is a deep mystery which has not yielded much to rational investigation. Second, what is the ancient history of the world going back to the beginning of time, if time has a beginning? The second question is also a deep mystery, but more amenable to rational investigation.

[Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology) tells us about the ancient history of the universe going back to the (theorized) Big Bang. But what is the universe, and is it the same thing as the world? In common usage these terms have nebulous meanings, but we'd like to be precise.

By "the universe," I shall mean "everything physical which is spatiotemporally connected to Earth," meaning everything to which there exists a path through space-time from Earth. This may, in fact, include everything, so that the universe and the world are the same entity. 

We do not have concrete physical evidence of any parts of the world which are not part of the universe. This makes a lot of sense, given that when people have concrete physical evidence of a thing, this is always the outcome of some kind of chain of causality proceeding through space-time from the thing to our sensory organs.

We do not know that the universe is all there is in the world. Many people believe there is more:

* [Most people adhere to religions](http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html) which postulate the existence of things outside the universe, such as gods, heavenly beings, and heavenly realms.
* Some physicists favor theories, such as the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) of quantum mechanics and the [mathematical universe hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis), which entail that there is a lot of stuff besides the universe in the world.
* Some philosophers favor theories which postulate the existence of things outside the universe. Popular or well-known views of this kind in contemporary [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) include [mathematical Platonism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/), [modal realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism), and various kinds of [realism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/) in metaphysics such as realism about [properties](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/) and [truthmakers](http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth-ma/).

It's hard to say whether there is anything in the world beyond the universe. By the nature of the case, we can't get concrete physical evidence of such things. Physicists and philosophers often appeal to the explanatory power of their theories, as well as arguing in various other ways. Religious belief systems often appeal to revelation, tradition, reason, and faith, among other ways.

For the rest of this post, our topic will be the history of the universe, with a focus on the part of it that we live in. We will discuss the formation of the universe as it is today, the formation and history of the solar system, and the history of Earth prior to the evolution of humans. Humans will be the primary focus of subsequent posts. The provincial, anthrocentric skew of this approach to history is obvious, but Earth and humans are primarily what we know about.
