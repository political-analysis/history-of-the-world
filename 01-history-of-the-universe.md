Cultures in all regions of the world for all of known history have had stories of the origins of the world. Since these stories contradict each other on so many points, most of them are false.

By "the world," I shall mean "what exists." In this nomenclature, the known universe is part of the world. We assume there are unknown things that exist, which are also part of the world. God is part of the world, if God exists; angels are part of the world if they exist; and so forth.

The question of the origins of the world is really a conflation of two potentially related questions. First, why does anything exist? This is a deep mystery which has not yieled much to rational investigation. Second, what is the ancient history of the world going back to the beginning of time, if time has a beginning? The second question is also a deep mystery, but more amenable to rational investigation.

In modern science, the Big Bang theory is the prevailing theory of the early history of the universe. By "the universe," I shall mean "everything physical which is spatiotemporally connected to Earth," meaning everything to which you could draw a line through space-time from Earth. This may, in fact, include everything, so that the universe and the world are the same entity.

We do not have concrete physical evidence of any parts of the world which are not part of the universe. This makes a lot of sense, given that when people have concrete physical evidence of a thing, this is always the outcome of some kind of chain of causality proceeding through space-time from the thing to our sensory organs.

We also do not know that the universe is all there is in the world. Many people believe there is more. 

* [Most people adhere to religions](http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html) which postulate the existence of things outside the universe, such as gods, heavenly beings, and heavenly realms.
* Some physicists favor theories, such as the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) of quantum mechanics and the [mathematical universe hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis), which entail that there is a lot of stuff besides the universe in the world.
* Some philosophers favor theories which postulate the existence of things outside the universe. Popular or well-known views of this kind in contemporary [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) include [mathematical Platonism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/), [modal realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism), and various kinds of [realism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/) in metaphysics such as realism about [properties](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/) and [truthmakers](http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth-ma/).
